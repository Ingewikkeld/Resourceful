Rest User Bundle
================

This bundle allows an application to manage its consumers by storing user credentials and
exposing user information using the webservice.

This bundle also demonstrates how to setup your own webservices, including the following best practices when designing
a bundle:

- Use translation for all your strings and use codes to represent them
- Decouple your controller from Symfony and use them from the Symfony DIC as a service
- Separating your service definitions in multiple XML files
